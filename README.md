# N-Developer-Plugin
First Notepad Plus Plus plugin, built around NotepadPlusPlusPluginPack.Net

So, 
There are a number of little tools that I have used in the past, as a developer, that I had to custom write.
I'm sure there are other plugins that also accomplish what I am attempting to do, but I figured I'd write my owm.

In the past, I'd write either a console, or winform application that would do what I needed it to do. I advanced to a html page, and javascript to do the work. Now, I am attempting my hands at writing a plugin, on my free time outside of work, that did the tasks from before. This way it's open source, and free for anyone to use. 
I am using the Apache 2 license since the templete I am building off of used it. I'd like to thank and give credit to Kasper B. Graversen (kbilsted) for his plugin
